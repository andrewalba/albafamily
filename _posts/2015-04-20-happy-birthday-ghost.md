Today is a special day! No, we don't have an agenda to try to legalize marijuana. Four-twenty is not a mantra we use, but instead we are celebrating April 20th as it is Ghost's birthday!

Our ninety-seven pound puppy is moving into adulthood. We celebrated the day by taking him shopping. Unfortunately we weren't able to get him a cake for the special day. We did pick up a fresh "pup" cake and some fresh treats. Then we headed to a second pet shop for a new nyla-bone, water buffalo horn and more treats.

I have been teasing the poor boy by yelling that there is a SQUIRREL just outside the house. That drives him just about insane trying to figure out just where it is, but it sure is funny to me.

Love ya Ghost!
