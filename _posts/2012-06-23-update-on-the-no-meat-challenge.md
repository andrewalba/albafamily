It has been almost two weeks since I have had some meat and I am still alive.

Going with out meat for two weeks has not been real tough actually. It is the dairy products that I really miss. Greek yogurt and cheese the most.

Eggs have been the other item I miss more then meat. But we are learning to find good substitutes. My favorite substitute, that I might just keep is almond milk for milk. It has good flavor and some better health benefits.

I have been battling with some type of yeast/bacterial issue the last few days. It makes me curious if it is part in due to missing some of those "good" bacteria that you get with dairy. The sore throat never made me miserable, but apparently the halitosis has been pretty bad for all those within a breathes distance from me (sorry friends).

With another two weeks to go, I can see a future with better nutritional choices ahead of me. I don't plan on giving up meat all together, but I am not afraid now to go a day (or several days for that matter) without eating it. I also have a new palette that enjoys things like broccoli, eggplant, asparagus, cucumbers that aren't pickles, and zucchini.

Gone are the days were I made most things in a box and instead I plan on making a lot more from scratch with the new blender and food processor.

Finally, I have to note that after two weeks I am close to have losing 10 pounds which is pretty amazing. The lose is only somewhat related to not eating meat. It is very much the result of carefully watching calories and getting some exercise.
