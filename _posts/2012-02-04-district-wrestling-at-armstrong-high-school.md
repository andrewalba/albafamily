Gage attended the district wrestling tournament at Armstrong High School in Plymouth, MN today. He had three matches and left the tournament with one win and two loses.

Here is video of match one.

According to Gage, the opponent in the video is a senior (no way to verify). Gage had a few missed opportunities in the match, but made it exciting. In the second period he almost pinned his opponent, but was later pinned himself after ending up in a bad position that he just couldn't get out of.

His second match was very good as well. Gage said this opponent was a junior that wrestled some on Junior Varsity. Gage made the most of the match, getting himself out of some bad spots. He was aggressive through out the match and gave his opponent a good run, but ended up getting pinned in the second period.

Pauline and I had to leave for the final match, so we did not see it, but we had seen his opponent before and knew that afterÂ watching the previous matches, Gage should come away with the win, which he did.
