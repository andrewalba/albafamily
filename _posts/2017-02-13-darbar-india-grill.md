Okay, I think I may have found a new "local" favorite! 

We had family up this weekend and wanted to try something different. Pauline had heard some positive reviews about Darbar Indian Grill and we decided to give it a try after a long morning of watching wrestling.

We headed to the restaurant between the lunch buffet and dinner and at first we were a little worried. The parking lot was empty as well as the restaurant. The open sign was on so we continued in and we were told that indeed the grill was open. My first impression was that if this place is empty, it might be because of the food.

Our hostess was new and not very helpful except to seat and fill drinks, but our server was fantastic. He took the time to explain the dishes and let us know we could ask for certain vegetables with the curry dishes. After looking at the menu for several minutes and asking questions, we all decided on our meals. I won't review them all but I do want to review two dishes (one I was going to get and the one I did get).

This American Pale Lager was surprisingly good. The lager poured into the glass resting with a golden straw color with very minimal head on it. It had a distinct salty aroma that reminded me of other American lagers that had a splash of olive juice added to it (something my wife and I will do to get that salty kick). The flavor was similar the smell and although this is not something I would run out and buy, it is something I would order again at the grill.

Our server returned after a short time with our meals. I originally was going to order the goat Mughlai, but I was looking for something a little more kick so ended up opting for the lamb Vindaldo, but was fortunate that my wife ordered chicken Mughlai.

Let me start with a quick review of the Mughlai. This dish was the best of the evening. Mughlai is "the king of curries" and it is a well deserved coronation. The dish was flavored with saffron and simmered gently in a blend of yogurt and various spices. Served over basmati rice with some naan or roti and you will think you have begun to be uplifted to heavens. Truly a splendid dish that we will have to enjoy more often.

My second review would be that of the lamb Vindaldo which is a Goan dish that can be very spicy. The tomato based sauce is made with vinegar, chili pepper and then stewed with garlic. Rich bold flavors that are delicious with every bite. I ordered this with a 3-4 on the spicy scale of five being hottest and was happy with the result, but I think I will try a little more spice next time.

The Roti was also good and went well with the dish. We had the Plain Dosa which is a light crepe made from rice and lentil served with chutney and sambhar. The plain dosa was good, but the flavors were not nearly as bold as the meal and it was lost (should have definitely left this as an appetizer).

As I was eating this meal I felt like I had found something special that everyone should know about. The problem was that the space was empty of patrons when I arrived and I couldn't understand why. As the evening progressed though the patrons started to flow in and I then understood. I was just very early for dinner that evening. 

So go try this place out and go early in the evening to get the best service and likely the best flavors that Apple Valley, Minnesota can offer you.
