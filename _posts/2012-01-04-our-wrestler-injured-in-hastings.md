Gage had a wrestling match in Hastings on Tuesday and during the first match was injured. We were not present at the match, but second hand accounts described the event as horrific.

Gage was being taken down and was attempting to take a defensive position. During the take down the opponent lifted Gage's leg and began to drive Gage across the mat. Gage had his shoulder and head catch the mat and the opponent continued to drive Gage's leg causing Gage to get twisted backwards.

His team mates cringed and after a loud audible groan, the match was stopped. Gage was able to move around, but was in a lot of pain. As a precaution, he was taken by "Amber Lamps"[Ambulance] to the emergency room in Hastings. He was looked at by the doctors and after reviewing the MRI and other X-Ray films, they decided there was no damage to his spine or shoulder. Gage however was in a lot of pain.

The doctors confirmed that he had a strained lumbar and although he had no restrictions, he would probably need a few days to let the pain subside. The doctor admitted that from the pain Gage was describing, it he had to have been twisted up pretty good.

We were able to get Gage out of the emergency room and into the truck one tiny step at a time. Knowing that the morning would be an even tougher time for him, he ended up staying home from school as he was unable to get up easily and walk.

It wasn't until late this evening that we were able to get him off the couch and up and walking. The hope is to get him back to school in the morning and hopefully wrestling early next week.

Anyone wanting to send him "Get Well" wishes can do so by dropping him a line on facebook [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000976403941]
