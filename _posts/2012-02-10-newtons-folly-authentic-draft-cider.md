The label is generic and there is no description of the draft on the label.

Grabbing a frozen mug and bottle of cider, it was quickly poured and provided a clear bubbly foreground to the frosty mug. The cider was golden red and effervescent while I took the time to snap a photo.

The cider smelled like... cider. To describe it would be to describe an apple wine. Nothing special about the aroma with this brew other then it was pleasant.

Few ciders have passed these lips in 40 years. The draft was sweet with a little tart and had it been dry it would have reminded me very much of a wine I made a few years back.

Overall there was nothing memorable about this cider and it was nothing more then pleasant.
