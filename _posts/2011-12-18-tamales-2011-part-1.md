Last year we didn't have the time or place to make tamales, so it was the first year in a few that we went without. Everyone made sure to let us know how much they missed our tamales.

This year we have the place, but time is short(probably because procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday, right?). The meat (a big piece of pork shoulder) was cooked up on Wednesday and we finally got around to shredding it today.

After a trip to three different grocery stores, we were able to wrangle up the ingredients. One new ingredient this year will be a new chili. We saw a few recipes that used the New Mexico chili instead of the traditional Ancho or California chili that we use. We decided to pick a bag up (actually it was the only chili at that particular store).

We are just preparing the chili's now and Andrew has said that the New Mexico chili is the best smelling chili he has ever sniffed. We hope the flavors are as delicious as the fragrant bouquet of the chili.

So the Tamale 2011 day one is completed. We have two nice big batches of meat prepared and will get to making the tamales tomorrow. If we have time we might try to make up a small batch of beef. We should have all of the necessary ingredients (minus the beef).

After cleaning Andrew has poured himself a large glass of flavored spirits (raspberry rum) with some Sierra Mist. Might have to have a sip of scotch before bed as well.
