It has been some time since I have posted. I have been meaning to write a few beer reviews and post some more about the diet, but haven't had the time between projects.

The house is a mess and I have to have the truck packed and ready to go in about two and a half hours so this will be a short post.

Last night Pauline and I became old as we were not cool enough to hang out with for the fireworks. Dayton and Gage both went with their friends to the park to watch the show. Senior wasn't feeling it I guess and declined to go with us.

The walk to the park isn't to far down the trail, but it was hot and muggy (the type of night where you can feel the wet air in your lungs). We go to the park about an hour before the show just as it started filling up. We were at the park just north of where they launch the fireworks.

We found a nice spot by a tree and tried to cool down in our chairs. There was a light breeze where we were that helped, but when you felt it, it just made you long for more. The fireworks started after 10:00 pm and it felt kind of odd just being Pauline and I there, but also was kind of nice. I guess this might just be how we celebrate things if Kobe really does move out some day.

Anyway, the fireworks were great and the finale was absolutely awesome (see the clip on the page). After the show we stumbled through the dark path home (I could still see the path well enough, but Pauline was more afraid of the things we couldn't see).

Coming into the house was a shock to the system as the air was cool and dry. Gage got dropped off by Dayton a little later and then soon left again for the night and Dayton straggled in before midnight grumpy still about her day at work.

I hope I never forget nights like last night though. Pauline and I talked about how great a night it was there. We both agreed that the only thing that could have made it better is if we lived closer to the lake.
