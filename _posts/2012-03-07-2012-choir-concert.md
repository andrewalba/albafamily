Had the pleasure of listening to Dayton and the rest of the Eastview High School Choir perform on Monday evening. The entire concert was entertaining. I am uploading two videos when Dayton was on stage. You should be able to spot her in the first video in the top row, second from the right.

The concert included other groups and several solos that were great. It is great to hear such great talent at the school. The concerts have really blown Pauline and I away.

Here is the second part of when Dayton was on stage. I didn't get the name of the first song, but I am sure she could tell you what it is if yo liked the short spunky song.
