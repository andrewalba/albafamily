We were afraid we might run out of tamales this Christmas, so we decided to make one more batch. We had some turkey in the freezer from Thanksgiving and some chicken breasts from enchiladas.

So began our first try at Turchicken tamales. We were able to get the first pot of tamales on the stove when we realized we forgot our Minnesota ingredient. We had neglected to put in the cheese.

Fortunately we had enough time to mix in our cheddar cheese and get the last pot of tamales going with the cheddar. I believe our Turchicken Cheddar tamales will be a hit. I only wish we had more then a dozen and a half of them.
