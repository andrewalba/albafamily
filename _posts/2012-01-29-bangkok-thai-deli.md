I have been enjoying the food at the Bangkok Thai Deli (BTD) for more then a year and a half now, but today was Pauline's birthday and I really wanted to share with her the little gem in Saint Paul.

We headed out to BTD shortly after church. The hope was that the Sunday traffic there would be light. We arrived there shortly after noon and the parking lot was full. I drove around the corner and parked on a residential street.

When you head inside the BTD you might get the wrong impression. The building is for most parts dumpy looking and the dining area is anything but sparkling clean. It is definitely not a five star atmosphere, but the food will more then make up for any qualms that you might have about the dining area.

While I have been to the BTD several times, this was Pauline's first time there, so I gave here several extra minutes to go through the extensive menu. After about five minutes, we had made our decisions. Our waitress came over to take our orders in her best broken english.

We started the lunch with an order of fresh Spring Rolls. A few minutes later the Spring Rolls arrived with a delicious peanut sauce. It took me just minutes to devour my Spring Roll while Pauline took her time to enjoy it.

Our server arrived with our food a few minutes later and was gracious enough to bring extra plates so we could share our meals. Pauline ordered the Rama Dish with Chicken while I ordered my usual Pad Thai.

The Pad Thai is the best I have ever had. It is a great mixture of noodles, egg, onion, sprouts and chicken with a delicious sauce. I squeeze the entire lime wedge over the steaming hot pile of noodles and notice I have become akin to a Pavlovian dog, salivating as I transfer the noodles to my plate.

I then took a few large scoops of white rice and added several spoon full of peanut sauce from Pauline's Rama Dish. The meal is very similar to the Rama Thai dish we enjoy in Moorhead, MN. The plate has Red Peppers, Broccoli, and chicken and one of the most flavorful peanut sauces around. You can see the chili seeds in the sauce, it is not too hot.

The meal was delicious and to add a little more cool to the spicy meal, I order a Thai Ice Tea. Not wanting to have to loosen my belt, Pauline convinces me we don't have to eat it all while we are there and can take what is left home. Afraid that I might have to share it, I hedge a little, but she convinces me.

Bangkok Thai Deli is not glamorous, but the food is so incredibly good you will lose yourself in the heaven that is spicy Thai food.
