The stout is described on the label as
<blockquote>A deliciously creamy stout in the Irish tradition- with its rich, tan head intact, this deep and dark-colored beer has the aroma and flavors of chocolate, roasted oats and coffee- allderived from the specialty malts used in the brewing process</blockquote>

The stout pours coffee black with slight carbonation and scanty a tan head. The brew has a weak aroma, but what little scent that comes through is good. It is a light fragrance of dark roast with quasi chocolate and coffee tones. This beer has far less scent then what it visually looks like it should possess.

Upon drawing a little from the glass, I tried swishing it through my mouth. It was delicious! The brew was heavy, sweet, carmel and foamy. After a few more draws, I found it went down smooth like a cream and left a part candied chocolate and dark roast coffee flavor that was sweet and bitter at the same time.

I enjoyed this beer, but was unable to taste the roasted oatmeal. It was a nice mix of creamy chocolate and dark roast.
