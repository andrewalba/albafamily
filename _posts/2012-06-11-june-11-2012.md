Starting new diet, but didn't have the common sense to sit down and plan meals for the week.

Left work without breakfast. I had planned on at least eating the organic cereal I bought, but no almond milk (except the chocolate). Ended up leaving with just a large glass of coffee.

Breakfast
16oz. cup of coffee - [wppp protien=0 carbs=0 fiber=0 fat=0]

Snack (late night)
Trader Joe's Harvest Grains Blend [wppp servings=.5 protein=6 carbs=34 fiber=2 fat=1]
Momma Chia- Coconut Mango [wppp servings=.6 protein=4 carbs=20 fiber=6 fat=4]

This Harvest Grains Blend is really good, but Pauline made it with just plain water. I think it would have been better with some vegetable stock instead.

Lunch plans were not much different. Also didn't help that every damn item of work needed to be completed over the lunch hour. I decided to just get out of the office about 2:20 pm and just drove. Came upon the Falafel King and decided to see what they had inside.

The menu was't to big, and I didn't really have time to look through the ingredients, so I went with what I thought would be the best meal available which was the Veggie Combo. The meal included hummus, spinach pie, King salad and falafel with tahini dressing. No idea about the nutritional value as I could not find them later online.

The falafel seemed just a tad greasy and I know the brocoli and egg plant were deep fried (and delicious). The hummus had good flavor, but the consistency was just a bit to smooth. The King salad was a nice tangy mixture of what looked like cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro and a salty pickle like dressing. The falafel and spinach pie were both good, but I had much better at The Black Sea Restaurant on the other side of St Paul. The brocoli and egg plant were the best part. They had a light seasoning to them and the texture was fantastic. It was by far the best part of the meal.

Lunch and Dinner
Pita, hummus, King salad, spinach pie and 2 falafel [wppp protein=15 carbs=59 fiber=9 fat=10 ]

Overall the meal was better then average and I would likely go there again. I think once I get more familiar with the menu, I might find the right combination of eats for this diet.
