The description of this ale on the label says it is 

<blockquote>An India Pale Ale style well suited for adventourus trips to the Upper Peninsula. American malts and enormous hop additions give this beer a crisp finish and an icredibly floral hop aroma.</blockquote>

This beer pours out well, with a nice bubbly head. The ale is clear and golden and the head is light with large frothy bubbles. The head is not as thick as most craft beers, but compared to other Trader Joe beers sampled the carbonation seems about right.

A light sniff picks up the distinct aromas of the hops. The ale smells like citrus with a bit of tea leaf. It is apparent from the first sip that this IPA is going to be nice and hoppy.

The first sips and the beer unloads its flavors of citrus and bitter hops. A big fan of IPA's this ale does not disappoint. The flavors tingle on the tongue and gullet. The bitterness lingers well after the drink is gone, but is a light bitter that is a welcome flavor.

Overall this is probably the best beer of the three reviewed so far. This could be a result of a bias towards IPA's but it is a great tasting brew that delivers exactly what the label promises plus a bit more.
