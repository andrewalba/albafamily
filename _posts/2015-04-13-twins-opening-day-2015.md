Hitting opening day at Target Field is a tradition I have kept since the ball park opened in 2010. It has been an experience over the years. The first year I had to be talked into spending the money to secure seats for the game. Our group ran into some issues on the way back from Milwaukee and we almost missed getting to the game on time. Since then I have endured some cold temperatures in the shade of the first base line and bathed in the glorious spring rays in left field (while others froze there butts off on the first base side).

Opening day at Target Field is a splendid day that marks the beginning of baseball in Minnesota. It brings to mind thoughts of warm summers on the deck, sitting in lawn chairs, eating sunflower seeds while watching softball, and pulling a cold beverage out of a frigid bath of ice water in the cooler. Here is to the Twins 2015 opener and the end of 2014 winter in Minnesota.
