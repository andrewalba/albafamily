Saturday started early with a trip to the High School to help work with the Freestyle Wrestling tournament. Really starting to enjoy the new people we are meeting and the group of parents in the Wrestling Boosters club have been fantastic. Feel bad that we didn't get involved sooner, but already plan to be much more involved next year.

The tournament ended before 3:00 pm and after we came home, I had to go take a nap. Four hours later, I realized it was getting dark and I had slept the better part of the afternoon away. It felt good, but also felt a little guilty. I was able to coerce Pauline down the the basement to watch the Roku. She wasn't a fan of the documentary I found, but was able to get her to come back to watch Louis C.K. stand up.

We were kicked out of the basement by Dayton and her friends later and retired to the bedroom. With temperatures aiming to the high 70's we had made plans to enjoy coffee on the deck. We both woke up before 7:30 and were sorely disappointed that it was COLD outside. Coffee by the window was the order for the morning.

It was really to bad we didn't have a nicer day out. We usually have a Mallard and his mate that visit the backyard. I was awaken by the quacking outside the window, but it wasn't the usual suspect this morning. It happened to be a new visitor, a Wood Duck. I was able to snap a few pictures before the memory card was full. Of course a few minutes later the mate appeared, but I wasn't able to get a photo.

Time to make some waffles and get the family going this morning.
