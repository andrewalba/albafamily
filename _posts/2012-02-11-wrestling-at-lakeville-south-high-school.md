Gage wrestled with some Junior Varsity wrestlers on February 11, 2012 at the Lakeville South High School in Lakeville, MN.

Here is match one which was a close loss.

Match two had Gage pitted against a fellow Lightening wrestler and although the score was lopsided, the match was fantastic to watch. Here is the second match.
