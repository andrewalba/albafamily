Grabbed a few pints from the local liquor store and one of them was a Hinerland Maple Bock brewed by <a href="http://www.hinterlandbeer.com/" title="Hinterland - Green Bay, WI" target="_blank">Green Bay Brewing Co. Green Bay, WI</a>.

This particular bock states that it is brewed with Maple Syrup. It is not clear if the syrup is from Wisconsin, but one can only hope it is. After separating the cap from the bottle, the beer is poured into the frosty mug. The bock is a cloudy dark chocolate with a thin tan head.

The bock has a distinct maple syrup smell with wisps of floral and alcohol. The fragrances are fantastic for such a dark beer.

The beer has a creamy texture that is thick and smooth. After sipping the bock a few times it was easy to sense the sweet maple syrup. There is a light citrus tingle from the hops, but it almost goes unnoticed. The beer has a sweetness to it, but it is subtle enough to be enjoyable. It is hard to distinguish the other flavors. There is a tangy after taste, but it is not really bitter.

Overall this was a good bock that isn't unique in flavor, but has flavors that all combined make a unique beer.
