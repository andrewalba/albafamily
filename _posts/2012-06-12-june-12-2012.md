Started the day off right today with some cereal. Wasn't paying attention when I poured it though and had probably two servings in the bowl. Put half back so bowl was about 1/3 full and then added about a half a cup of almond milk. Delicious!

Took off in time to pick up Gage and take him to the game. Was a fantastic day to watch the team go up against a not so good Rosemount. It wasn't meant to be for the Lightning as it was a pitchers dual and the Lighting came up a run short (1-2).

Gage pitched a good four innings, giving up 2 runs on 1 hit, 4 walks and 3K's. His team mate John came in and pitched well walking a pair and striking out a pair, but holding the Rosemount team to the two runs. They did their best against a really good Rosemount pitcher. They were making contact with the ball, but they were hitting the ball right to the defense.
