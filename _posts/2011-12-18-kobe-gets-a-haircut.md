Big news everyone. Kobe has finally went in to get a haircut.

For those of you that don't know it, Kobe enjoys to keep his afro long and although we aren't agains the long hair, we do have a tough time with him not grooming it.

Apparently after several months of us pestering him to get a haircut, he finally caved and went in with Gage to get a haircut.

The results were stunning. Instead of looking eleven years old, I think he looks at least thirteen. It is a dramatic change that we all like for the best (including Kobe).

Here is some footage right after the cut!
