The pilsner style lager is made from Sorghum and is brewed and bottled by <a href="http://www.stpetersbrewery.co.uk" title="St. Peters Brewery" target="_blank">St. Peter's Brewery</a>, Suffolk, United Kingdom.

The beer poured out with a thin head and a slightly cloudy golden orange color. There is some decent carbonation, but not much of a head to the brew.

The brew has a citrus aroma from the Amarillo hops, so I almost immediately salivate with the thought of another great beer with full hop flavor.

I had a few mouthfuls and I have to say i was a little surprised with how little "pop" the beer has. The flavors are mild, tangy and little to no bitter. The brew drinks as if it is a flat pilsner. There is a lingering taste that is good, but just can't get over how flat the beer is.

The brew is not something I found as satisfying as what was promised on the label.
