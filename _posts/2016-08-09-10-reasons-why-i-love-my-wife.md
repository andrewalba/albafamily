After more then 20 years of marriage I find myself even more "madly" in love with my exquisite and wonderful wife Pauline. She has been patient, supportive and gracious to me even when I don't deserve it.

I am constantly amazed how selfless and devoted she has been to our children and for that I am extremely grateful. She has poured that same benevolence upon me and I will be forever thankful for such a blessing.

So, to honor my wife on our 20th anniversary, I am going to share the <strong>10 Reasons Why I Love My Wife</strong>.

<h3>1. Her Cooking Has Evolved</h3>
When we first were married, Pauline used a small set of spices (salt and pepper) for most dishes. She has really spiced things up since and has come up with some amazing ways to make us eat healthier.


<h3>2. Her Smile Still Rouses Me</h3>
After 20 plus years, she still has the ability to flash me a smile that lets me know she wants me. Yes, with just a subtle lifting of her brow and that Mona Lisa smile, my heart starts pumping a littler harder.


<h3>3. She Laughs at Everything</h3>
I have always thought I had an above average sense of humor, but then I have had a wife who will laugh at almost everything I do (sometimes when I don't think it is funny). Just ask our kids. If you have a silly "not so funny" joke, mom will laugh the hardest every time.


<h3>4. She Trusted God's Plan For Us</h3>
Pauline didn't come into our relationship with a great deal of religious instruction, but she has over the years developed a solid faith in God. I love when she reminds me of a sermon lesson when trying to correct my poor behavior. Her devotion to God only makes my devotion that much greater.


<h3>5. She Loves Camping</h3>
When we first married, we often found ourselves camping with babies/toddlers. Sometimes it was chaotic, but she always made sure we had everything packed and everyone had what they needed. As the years went by, our tents increased in size, tents evolved into pop up campers and now we enjoy a small apartment on wheels late into the fall. These camping moments have been some of my most treasured memories.


<h3>6. She Has Never "Kept Score"</h3>
I have been boastful many times throughout our 20 years together, but Pauline has never been one to keep score on what she has accomplished (either around the house or in her career). Her humility make me strive to serve <strong>each other</strong> going forward rather then keeping score of what I have accomplished around the house (or in my career).


<h3>7. She Always Has Believed In Us</h3>
Times haven't always been so hunky dory with our marriage, but no matter what we have went through, she has always believed in our relationship. I know there have been many days/nights where she just wanted to be without me for a few days, but she has always come back to me.

<h3>8. We've Grown Closer Together</h3>
We had our seasons where we drifted apart, but the last few years we have really changed things. We are closer on a deeper spiritual level as well as an emotional and physical level in the last few years. 


<h3>9. Warmth of Her Hugs</h3>
She has a way of knowing when times are stressful and will make a point of stopping whatever we are doing to embrace. Her hug has the ability to melt a lot of stress from a situation and is a subtle reminder of just how blessed I am.


<h3>10. Waking Up Each Morning</h3>
There was a long season of my life where I took my wife for granted. That season has passed and thankfully I am reminded most every morning of what a blessing God has provided me through my wife. When I wake in the morning and see her, I feel love.

Me loving Pauline as a mother and wife is not limited to 10 reasons, but those are just 10 examples of why she means so much to me.

I shared the following with Pauline a while back. At the time I was looking for a verse to help her get through a hard time at work, but I was also struggling with our relationship. My path led me to finding a piece of scripture that helped me get through a hard time in our relationship and I can't help but go back to this often. 


<blockquote>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</blockquote>
1 Corinthians 13:4-8
