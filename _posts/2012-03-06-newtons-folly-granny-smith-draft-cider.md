It is just another flavor of the other <a href="https://www.albafamily.com/review/newtons-folly-authentic-draft-cider" title="Newton's Folly Authentic Draft Cider">Newtonâ€™s Folly Authentic Draft Cider</a> I reviewed earlier.

The bottle was opened and soon poured into a nice clean glass. There was no head, but a nice steady stream of carbonation along certain sides of the glass. The clear brew has just a slight greenish gold color to it.

A slow inhale through the nose picks up sweet apple and a hint of alcohol much like a wine. This cider is much sweeter smelling then I remember the last.

A few sips and it seems to be an effervescent sweet and then tart flavor that ends with an alcohol flavor that reminds me of a wine. I actually enjoy the bubbly sweetness mixed with the strong sour.

The cider tingles in the mouth, but is much tamer when swallowed.

Overall this is a much better flavor then the previous cider I tasted from Newton's Folly. It still has a wine finish, but the hard tart flavor after the initial sweet is good. The only thing missing is more apple flavor.
