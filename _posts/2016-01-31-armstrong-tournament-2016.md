Traveled to the Armstrong Wrestling Tournament yesterday to enjoy a few hours of wrestling. As always the Tournament was fast paced with both the Varsity Duals and Junior Varsity individual tournament starting shortly after 9:30 am on the eight mats.

Kobe was put into bracket Q with wrestlers from Fridley, Mahtomedi and Woodbury. His first match was against the eventual champion of the bracket.

The second match was against a tough opponent from Mahtomedi that went late into the third period.

The final match was absolutely crazy. Kobe last match pitted him against a wrestler from Woodbury and it was six minutes of wild scrambling, reversals and some controversy over points awarded. After the first period the score was adjusted from Kobe being ahead 10-7 to 8-10 in favor of the Woodbury wrestler.

The final two periods were just as crazy, but the scoring was a bit more accurate all the way up to the last few minutes, but Kobe was able to win the match 22-14.
