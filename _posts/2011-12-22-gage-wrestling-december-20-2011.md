Been trying to find time to publish this, but been a busy few days.

Gage made weight easily thanks to two days with a stomach bug. He said he came in at just over 135 pounds (wrestles at 138 and gets two pounds now, so really is 5 pounds under).

Unfortunately for him, there was no one on the other two teams that was in his weight class. He wanted a match though, so the coach was able to arrange for him to get an exhibition match with a another wrestler at 132 pounds.

Enjoy!
