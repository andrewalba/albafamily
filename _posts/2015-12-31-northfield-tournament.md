After a long delay to get the wresting started (about a three hour delay), action commenced and Kobe had to suffer through a bye the first round.

After waiting a long period of time to start the matches, Kobe was caught off guard and had to wrestle near the start of the second round. With the combination of confusion and chaos, Kobe went out without the proper mental attitude and faced a solid opponent and lost.

He was upset with the start of the tournament, but decided the experience wasn't going to spoil his day. He went into the second match with a resolve and after grappling with the second opponent for sometime, he was able to get a takedown and quick pin.

The third match pitted him against a fellow Eastview wrestler and friend. The two were determined to give each other his best. It was a quick match that ended with Kobe falling his teammate quickly, but with some controversy as both claim Kobe did not have the pin when it was called.

The last match for 5th place was a great match. Kobe faced off with a decent opponent and although he controlled almost all of the match, there were times when he put himself in a bad spot and almost lost the match. The match went to a decision which Kobe won.
