Headed to Mound, MN for wrestling tournament where Gage got to wrestle varsity for the first time in 2014. 

Gage was lucky enough to draw the number one ranked wrestler at 152 MN AA. Tough draw, but he bravely went out and did his best. Unfortunately there was no major upset, but he wrestled well. Gage lost by fall late in the first period to Mack Short of Simley.

His second match he faired much better winning by fall midway through the first period against Air Chaisattayarak of St. Croix Lutheran.

The last match was best wth Gage wrestling a strong 152 pound senior Cole Anderly from Westonka-Mounds for 5th place.
