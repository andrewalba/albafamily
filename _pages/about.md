This site was created so that the Alba Family of Apple Valley, MN can share their lives with friends and family. In the process if we can teach each other how to write intelligent sentences, use proper grammar, learn some basic coding [HTML, CSS], then the site will have been a total success.

The family had it's humble beginnings in Dilworth, MN in 1996 and recently moved to the Saint Paul, Minnesota suburb of Apple Valley late in the summer of 2011.

Andrew is currently a software engineer for Internet Broadcasting in Saint Paul, Minnesota and has been developing web sites for over 10 years.

Pauline is an Aquatics Director for multiple Y sites [formerly YMCA] in North Minneapolis, MN and has been working for the Y in that capacity for over 10 years.

Dayton and Gage are currently enrolled at Eastview High School where they each participate in several activities. Dayton has joined the prestigious dance team and is excelling academically. Gage has played football and wrestling and is looking forward to the upcoming baseball season.

Kobe is enrolled at Scott Highlands Middle School and is adjusting to his larger classes and the vast amount of homework. He plays the trumpet and enjoys watching videos and playing video games.

It is our hope that you will find this site entertaining and humorous as we share moments of our lives with you our friends and family.
